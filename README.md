# tart

Tart is an asynchronous microcontroller library written in C++20. It is designed around
C++20 coroutines. The library is intended to be used in place of other SDKs, and as such
provides it's own driver for peripherals and such.

Note that this library is under active development and as such the APIs may change at any
time and should not be considered stable for the time being.
